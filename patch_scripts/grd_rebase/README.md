# GRD/XTB Rebase

This directory contains the reviewed Thorium GRD/GRDP and XTB rebase tooling
for moving Thorium string changes out of the overlay and into repeatable
scripts.

The runtime surface is intentionally small:

- `sync_grd_strings.py` updates reviewed Chromium GRD/GRDP messages, computes
  old and new GRIT translation IDs, and copies compatible upstream XTB
  translations to the new Thorium IDs.
- `merge_thorium_xtb.py` merges reviewed Thorium-owned translation additions
  from `config/m150_xtb_additions.tsv` into Chromium XTB bundles.
- `update_config_from_patches.py` refreshes low-risk config rows that can be
  derived from the current patch series.

These scripts use only the Python standard library. They do not require
`vpython`, `depot_tools`, or a Chromium checkout's Python wrapper. Python 3.11
or newer is the supported runtime.

## Configuration

The files in `config/` are reviewed inputs, not generated setup output:

- `file_allowlist.csv`: reviewed GRD/GRDP file scope and file ownership role.
  `from_overlay` records the legacy source of the reviewed change; pure
  `overlay_text_sync` files do not need to remain under `src/` once their
  messages are covered by automatic branding discovery or
  `message_allowlist.csv`.
- `message_allowlist.csv`: reviewed message-level exceptions and special
  replacements. Plain branding replacements are auto-discovered from
  `file_allowlist.csv` text-sync files; this CSV only keeps special rows.
- `feature_patch_message_ownership.csv`: feature-patch and overlay-added
  message ownership; used to prevent feature-patch strings from being handled
  by the overlay replacement workflow.
- `m150_xtb_additions.tsv`: canonical reviewed translation additions; currently
  3888 translation rows across 324 XTB files. Rows are grouped by the explicit
  `owner_patch` column, then by bundle, translation ID, and locale;
  `source_path` separately records where each translation was recovered or
  reviewed.

`update_config_from_patches.py` may rewrite
`config/feature_patch_message_ownership.csv` and
`config/file_allowlist.csv` by default. It does not rewrite
`message_allowlist.csv` or `m150_xtb_additions.tsv`; those remain reviewed
inputs because they contain special text behavior or translation-data
decisions.

## Run Order

Run the scripts after Chromium and non-string feature patches are in place:

1. Run `sync_grd_strings.py`.
2. Run `merge_thorium_xtb.py`.

This order keeps overlay-derived old/new ID syncing separate from reviewed
Thorium-owned additions.

## Python Runtime

Use any Python 3.11+ interpreter available on the host:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/sync_grd_strings.py --help
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/merge_thorium_xtb.py --help
```

On Windows, either `py -3.11`, a normal `python.exe`, or
`C:\src\depot_tools\python3.bat` can be used. The depot_tools wrapper is only a
convenient Chromium-environment Python, not a requirement for these scripts.

All config paths stored in this directory use repository-relative POSIX-style
paths. Command-line paths may use native platform separators or `/`; the scripts
normalize them internally where needed.

## Dry Run

Dry-run low-risk config refresh:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/update_config_from_patches.py --dry-run
```

Dry-run the overlay string sync and write compact audit summaries:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/sync_grd_strings.py \
  /path/to/chromium/src \
  --file-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/file_allowlist.csv \
  --message-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/message_allowlist.csv \
  --dry-run \
  --xtb-conflict-report out/grd_rebase/m150_xtb_conflicts_summary.tsv \
  --xtb-missing-report out/grd_rebase/m150_xtb_missing_summary.tsv \
  > out/grd_rebase/m150_grd_sync_dry_run.tsv
```

Dry-run the reviewed additions merge:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/merge_thorium_xtb.py \
  /path/to/chromium/src \
  --dry-run
```

Expected current additions summary:

```text
validated 3888 Thorium translations across 324 XTB files: 3807 inserted, 74 refreshed, 7 already present, 324 files changed
```

Equivalent PowerShell form:

```powershell
py -3.11 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/sync_grd_strings.py `
  C:\src\chromium\src `
  --file-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/file_allowlist.csv `
  --message-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/message_allowlist.csv `
  --dry-run `
  --xtb-conflict-report out/grd_rebase/m150_xtb_conflicts_summary.tsv `
  --xtb-missing-report out/grd_rebase/m150_xtb_missing_summary.tsv `
  > out/grd_rebase/m150_grd_sync_dry_run.tsv

py -3.11 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/merge_thorium_xtb.py `
  C:\src\chromium\src `
  --dry-run
```

## Apply

Refresh low-risk config from the current patch series:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/update_config_from_patches.py
```

Apply overlay GRD/GRDP replacements and copied XTB translations:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/sync_grd_strings.py \
  /path/to/chromium/src \
  --file-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/file_allowlist.csv \
  --message-allowlist patch_scripts/grd_rebase/config/message_allowlist.csv
```

Apply reviewed XTB additions:

```bash
python3 patch_scripts/grd_rebase/merge_thorium_xtb.py \
  /path/to/chromium/src
```

All apply operations are designed to be idempotent.

## GRIT ID Notes

`sync_grd_strings.py` contains a lightweight GRIT message ID replica for
auto-discovered branding messages and reviewed special messages. It matches
Chromium's `GenerateMessageId()` fingerprint and meaning-combination behavior:

- MD5 first 64 bits interpreted as signed.
- Optional `meaning` fingerprint combined with the message fingerprint.
- The high bit is stripped to produce a positive decimal ID.
- `use_name_for_id="true"` returns the message name.
- `<ph name="...">` uses the placeholder presentation/name in presentable
  content.

The replica is intentionally scoped to reviewed text-sync files plus explicit
special messages. If future special entries include conditional message bodies
that need platform-specific active-branch resolution, compare against Chromium
GRIT parser output before enabling them.

## Reports

`sync_grd_strings.py` can write compact audit reports:

- `--xtb-conflict-report`: summarized converged new-ID conflicts where multiple
  old translations map to the same new ID. The script deterministically keeps
  the first candidate and reports grouped review buckets instead of every
  locale row.
- `--xtb-missing-report`: summarized mapped XTB lookups where the old Chromium
  translation ID was not found. Missing translations are reported but do not
  block the run.

Current dry-runs may print warnings for converged XTB conflicts and missing old
IDs. Those warnings are expected when their TSV reports are reviewed.

## Validation

Basic syntax checks:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile \
  patch_scripts/grd_rebase/update_config_from_patches.py \
  patch_scripts/grd_rebase/sync_grd_strings.py \
  patch_scripts/grd_rebase/merge_thorium_xtb.py
```

Behavior validation should run the dry-run command and inspect the compact
reports:

- conflict summary should be grouped into a small number of review buckets;
- missing summary should group all missing locales per message.

The full dry-run TSV is useful for script refactors and spot checks, but it is
not intended to be reviewed line by line.
